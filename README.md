# Learning C
A repo of my solutions to programming projects and other exercises from _C Programming: A Modern Approach_ by K. N. King.

# Goals
* Maintain a consistent, readable coding style
* Thoroughly analyze the problems and exercises to give new concepts time to sink in
* Presume nothing based on prior knowledge, but use that to guide thoughtful questions and research
